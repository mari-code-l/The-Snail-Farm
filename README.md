## **Introduction**

Welcome to my second milestone project, "The Snail Farm" website.

Hopefully this project will show some fundamental learning and understanding of JavaScript with the combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I aim to create an interactive website based on what I have learned from the course.

My inspiration for this project comes from my interests on snail farming, and having adventure in the farm at the same time.

I am a fan of minimalism which I applied on my project because I believe that less is more.

Below is an outline and the steps taken behind the project.

Thank you for viewing this project.

## **UXD – User Experience Design**

The goal of my project should provide a positive emotional experience for the user. The reality as developers is that it can be easy to implement features, which is good, but forgetting what matters most is for the users to interact easily with the project.

The project has 5 planes,
- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

## **Strategy Plane**

The Strategy Plane consists of an idea to help us to better understand the goals of the project. I created 2 stories which are "developer stories and user stories".

### **Developer Stories** ###

- As a developer, I want to use images which are earth colors to not to exaggerate the projects contrast and to response a positive emotional.

- As a developer, I would like a simple typography in the project which is comfortable to look at and is  easy to read.

- As a developer, I want the project to be responsive.

### **User Stories** ###

- As a user, I want the landing page to help me understand what is the project all about.

- As a user, I should be able to navigate to the relevant pages and social links that will give me complex Information about the product.

- As a user, I want to be able to see the different locations of the farm through a map.

- As a user, I would like to see a responsive contact form to get in touch through email and inquire about the product.

- Most of the time im on my mobile so as a user I want to research online using my mobile phone.

## **Scope Plane**

My issue creating this project with the goals I had was the timeframe fixing issues and bugs with the lack of experience using JavaScript. So I have decided to start with a minimal viable product (MVP). So here is my plan to reach my goal for an effective website.

**Page 1**
- A home page, with a navigation menu at the center top.
- A logo on top left with a quote describing the project and linked into home page when clicked.
- Slide images on the landing page that explains the whole context of the project. 
- Social links button at the bottom of the page so that the user can explore more about the product.

**Page 2**

- Navigation menu, logo, and social links are in this page as well.
- About us page which tells a short story of the founder of the company.

**Page 3** 

- Navigation menu, logo, and social links are in this page too.
- Things to do page which includes images and text of different activities.
- A map with different locations of the farm.
- Different cities when being clicked, it will zoom the area.

**Page 4** 

- It is a contact section which has the same logo, navigation menu an social links.
- Contact details of the company is on the left side.  
- On the right side is a contact form where the user can fill it up. There are input boxes for name, email address 
and type message.

## **Structure Plane**

**Colors**

I have decided to use earth colors background image which i find it simple yet classy which will match the text colors. The text colors i simply used black and white fro its simple and clean look. 

I have always been one who prefers minimalism look which I find more catchy and focused on the purpose of the project in every aspects.

**Typography**

I chose Heebo and Lobster, cursive for this project. 
Lobster, cursive for the logo which I find it nice. Heebo for the general text. I find it modern, easy on the eyes, and readable. 
It wont distract the user and it won't exxagerate the website.

## **Skeleton Plane**

Below are the screenshots of wireframes.

For this project, I used balsamiq for its convenience.

## **Surface Plane**

- The home page has a navigation menu. It link to the relevant pages.
- The Navbar changes to a hamburger menu when its on mobile and Ipad devices.
- Large hero image to draw the users attention. It keeps the attention of the user consisted and interested on th
- Earth colors background for its simplicity yet eye catching to target the users emotion and it won't distract users when its too colorful.
- Different images that explains the whole context of the product. 
- Contact form to get in touch and inquire with the company.

## **Testing**

**[User Story testing](/workspace/the-snail-story/assets/images/mix-img/testing.pdf)**

**Further Testing**

I used Chrome Dev Tools used to test the responsiveness of the following devices,
- Laptop with MDPI screen
- Laptopwith HiDPI screen
- Laptop with touch
- Apple Ipad Pro
- Apple Ipad
- Apple Ipad mini
- Samsung Galaxy S5
- Google Pixel 2/2 XL
- Apple iPhone 6/7/8
- Apple iPhone 6/7/8 Plus
- Apple iPhone X

W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator are used to validate HTML and CSS. 
All errors were corrected.

I used JSHint to check JavaScript code.
All errors were corrected. 

Due to lack of time and lack of experience, I was unable to effectively unit test my JavaScript. I simply try a trial and error test whether the functions correctly works. Trial and error is my method if it functions properly.

I checked Chrome dev tools for any errors in the console. 

I tested also the functions with tutor support team.

-For the future testing I am still learning and woking hard on it to give the best out of me when it comes to Javascript.

## **Bugs and Fixes**

**Technical**

- Coding google maps, I thought is that easy based on what I have learned from Code Institute but not at all! I have followed the Code Institute learning video and watch tutorial instructions but then I failed again and again. I have learned that mixing different tutorials could be gone to chaos. Coding is very complex. There are so much tutorials, learning materials, techniques etc. that you can be found online. I fixed the bug by doing trial and error and finally it worked!

- Emailjs was such a frustrating issue because I couldn't figure it out what I have been doing wrong beacuse It shows error 404 when I try to submit the contact form. I followed the Code Institute tutorial to find it out what was the bug. I have contacted the tutorial support. They found out that there was missing in the script and there was a missing word with the value of the functions.

- Issues that the image slideshow doesn't show up. I figure it out by trial and error and searching for tutorials, there was missing in my CSS code  which is @keyframes.

- The alignment of the contact form in different devices was a struggle. I did trial and error to position them and it works by changing different sizes of the margin, padding, justify content etc.

- The Gitpod crashed down a couple of times all of a sudden and I wasn't able to commit my work then I had to commit in chunks.

**Project Barriers**

- The biggest issue for me while doing this project is that I didn't have enough time from the beginning because I had to resubmit my MS1 project due to minor bugs while I am starting my MS2 project. 

- It also plays a big role that I am sick for a week while doing this project but I have to keep on continuing. I've been living alone in Germany for four years now without family around to take care of me when I am struggling with health issues so I guess this new career path that I chose with Code Institute, I believe that it is a huge change (from Tourism to IT) keeps me motivate for my future career.
